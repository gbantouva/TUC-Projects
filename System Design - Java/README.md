**Course**: System Design  
Technical University of Crete - School of Electrical and Computer Engineering  
Academic Year: 2023-2024  
**Student**: Georgia Bantouva (2019030006)

## Overview

A Java-based application for planning and managing team building events. The system uses object-oriented design principles and design patterns to create a flexible, maintainable event planning platform.

## System Architecture

The application implements a three-tier MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:

**Model Layer**
- Event data management
- Customer and booking information
- Event type definitions (outdoor activities, workshops, dining events)

**View Layer**
- User interface components
- Event browsing and selection
- Booking confirmation displays

**Controller Layer**
- Business logic implementation
- Event scheduling and coordination
- Customer request processing

## Core Functionality

**Event Management**
- Create and configure different types of team building events
- Manage event details (date, location, capacity, pricing)
- Support for multiple event categories

**Booking System**
- Customer registration and authentication
- Event booking and reservation
- Booking history and tracking

**Event Types Supported**
- Outdoor activities and adventures
- Team workshops and training sessions
- Dining and social events
- Custom event combinations

## Design Patterns Implemented

- **MVC Pattern**: Separation of concerns between data, presentation, and logic
- **Factory Pattern**: Event creation and instantiation
- **Observer Pattern**: Event notification and updates
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different event pricing and booking strategies

## Technologies

- **Language**: Java
- **Architecture**: MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- **IDE**: Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA
- **Concepts**: Object-Oriented Design, Design Patterns, Software Architecture

## Key Features

- Modular and extensible architecture
